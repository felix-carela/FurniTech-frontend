# Furnitech

FurniTech is an application designed to facilitate the exploration and purchase of a wide array of furniture products. Users have the capability to establish an account, peruse an extensive inventory of furniture items, and conveniently add their selections to the shopping cart for either immediate or deferred acquisition. Inspiration from RH furniture's eccomerce website.

## How to work on this App
This app let users can create their own account. Before they sign in to an existing account or sign up, users can only view the catalog of available items. They cannot add those items to the cart. This furniture app shows 4 categories  for home-furnishings. User also can view item's details that include dimension, color, price, and about info. User's shopping cart will show selected items image, quantity and price. User can remove items from their own cart and add more furniture on that order.
